# OIModules - A Macaulay2 Package
## Introduction
This Macaulay2 package allows one to compute Gröbner bases and free resolutions for submodules of free OI-modules over Noetherian polynomial OI-algebras. For an introduction to the topic, see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09247v2).
## Installation and Documentation
The package itself is located in the top directory. Download the file `OIModules.m2` and launch an instance of Macaulay2 in the same directory as the package. Then install the package by running the command
```Macaulay2
installPackage "OIModules"
```
View the documentation by running 
```Macaulay2
viewHelp OIModules
```
To load the package in the future, run 
```Macaulay2
needsPackage OIModules
```
